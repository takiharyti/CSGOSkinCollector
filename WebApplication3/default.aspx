        CS:GO Collector is a database of all the official CS:GO skins and items. CS:GO, short for Counter Strike Global Offensive is a first person shooter video game based on search and destroy.
        A team of five "terrorists" will seek to plant the bomb at any of the two bomb-sites and will seek to either eliminate the other team or to let the timer reach zero after planting the bomb,
